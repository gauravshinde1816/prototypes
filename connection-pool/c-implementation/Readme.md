## Blocking Queue Implementation:

## What `pthread_cond_wait(&queue->not_full, &queue->mutex)` does:

This line is the **heart of the blocking behavior**. Here's what happens:

### The Magic of `pthread_cond_wait`:
1. **ðŸ”“ Releases the mutex** - So other threads can access the queue
2. **ðŸ˜´ Puts thread to sleep** - Waiting for the `not_full` condition to be signaled  
3. **ðŸ”” Wakes up when signaled** - Another thread calls `pthread_cond_signal(&not_full)`
4. **ðŸ”’ Re-acquires the mutex** - Before returning, so the thread can safely continue

### Why is this needed?

**The Problem:** When the queue is full (`tail == MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`), we can't add more items. But we don't want to just return an error - we want to **wait** until space becomes available.

**The Solution:** 
- **Release the lock** so other threads can dequeue items (making space)
- **Sleep** until someone signals that space is available
- **Wake up and try again**

### Simple analogy:
Think of it like a parking lot:
- ðŸš— You want to park (enqueue) but lot is full
- ðŸ”“ You step away from the entrance (release mutex) 
- ðŸ˜´ You wait nearby for someone to leave
- ðŸ”” Security guard tells you "space available!" (signal)
- ðŸ”’ You go back to entrance (re-acquire mutex)
- âœ… You park your car!

The `pthread_cond_wait` line ensures that enqueue **blocks** (waits) when the queue is full, rather than failing or spinning in a busy loop.
